How to play:

Controls. 
    Control the snake using:
    Direction keys  i.e. Up, Down, Left, Right.

Eating.
    Eat the Red dot that appears randomly in the game area.
    The snake will grow larger each time the "food" is eaten.
    The snakes speed will increase each time the "food" is eaten.

Crashing:
    Crashing into the game area boundary or into yourself means death.
    Also if you have eaten atleast once and you press the opposite direction to the direction the snake is moving in you will "eat" yourself.
    Crashing or eating yourself ends the game.
